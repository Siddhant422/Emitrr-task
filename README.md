# Exploding Kittens Card Game 🃏

Welcome to the Exploding Kittens card game! This online, single-player game challenges you to draw cards from a deck while avoiding the exploding kittens that could make you lose. Let’s take a look at how the game functions and how you can play it on your local setup.

## Working
### Rules:
- **Types of Cards in the game:**
  - 😺 **Cat Card**: Harmless card, just a cute cat.
  - 🙅‍♂️ **Defuse Card**: Used to defuse an exploding kitten.
  - 🔀 **Shuffle Card**: Shuffles the deck and resets the game.
  - 💣 **Exploding Kitten Card**: Instant game over if drawn.

- **Gameplay:**
  - Clicking on the deck will reveal a card.
  - If the card is a cat card, it is taken out of the deck.
  - If you draw an exploding kitten and don’t have a defuse card, you lose the game.
  - If you draw a defuse card, it’s removed from the deck and can be used later to neutralize an exploding kitten.
  - If you draw a shuffle card, the deck is reshuffled, and the game restarts.
  - To win, you need to draw all the non-exploding kitten cards.

### For Node.js (React Frontend):
1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start the frontend server: `npm start`
3. Access the game at: `http://localhost:8000`

### For Go Lang (Backend):
1. Install dependencies: `go mod tidy`
2. Build the Go server: `go build -o main`
3. Start the server: `./main.`

Sure, here are the steps to set up Redis for your project along with some example code snippets:

### For Redis DB(Backend):

#### Step 1: Install Redis

First, you need to install Redis on your system. You can download and install Redis from the official website or use package managers like `apt` or `brew` depending on your operating system.

#### Step 2: Start Redis Server

Start the Redis server on your local machine. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
redis-server
redis-server-start
```

This command will start the Redis server with default configurations.


#### Step 3: Close Redis Connection

Don't forget to close the Redis connection when you're done:

```bash
redis-server-stop
```
That's it! You've successfully set up Redis for your project and connected to it using Go Lang. Now you can use Redis to store and retrieve data as needed.
